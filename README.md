# swayam_quiz_solver
  A Python script that brutefore answers and finds the correct one. Swayam validates the answers client side also expose the score after every submission, by using this data I wrote a simple python script completes every single answer 4 choices MCQs for you. It doesn't work with multiple answer quizes it is possible to bruteforce them too but that would put heavy load on the backend servers which might end up as DOS.
